# About the Creator

I'm a creative writer and AI enthusiast with a passion for storytelling, communication, and innovative tech. My background blends narrative craft with casual explorations in AI, making this blog a hub for brainstorming, writing tips, and insightful discussions.

This digital garden started as my personal Obsidian vault – a place to jot down ideas, link thoughts, and build knowledge graphs. Now, thanks to Jekyll, it's a professional space open to everyone. Expect posts on everything from plot twists in fiction to ethical AI dilemmas, all in a relaxed, engaging style.

If you're here for inspiration or collaboration, let's connect! Find me on socials or drop a note.
